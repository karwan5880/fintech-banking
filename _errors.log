GET http://localhost:3001/sign-up/SignUp_clerk_catchall_check_1764665294196 404 (Not Found)

Uncaught (in promise) Error: 
Clerk: The <SignUp/> component is not configured correctly. The most likely reasons for this error are:

1. The "/sign-up" route is not a catch-all route.
It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "/sign-up/[[...rest]]/page.tsx". Alternatively, you can update the <SignUp/> component to use hash-based routing by setting the "routing" prop to "hash".

2. The <SignUp/> component is mounted in a catch-all route, but all routes under "/sign-up" are protected by the middleware.
To resolve this, ensure that the middleware does not protect the catch-all route or any of its children. If you are using the "createRouteMatcher" helper, consider adding "(.*)" to the end of the route pattern, eg: "/sign-up(.*)".
